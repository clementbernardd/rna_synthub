RNA-SyntHub is a pipeline applied to create curated RNA structures data. 
It has been applied to a set of !(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewfavor/uw-synthetic-rna-structures)[447,402 synthetic RNA] structures 
and enforced by predictions from !(https://rnacomposer.cs.put.poznan.pl/)[RNAComposer] and !(https://github.com/jwohlwend/boltz)[Boltz-1]
